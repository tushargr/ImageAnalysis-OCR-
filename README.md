# ImageAnalysis
This project was done under Programming Club, IIT Kanpur.
This projects aims at analysing images and extracting features like text and face detection from it.
The script takes text image as input in which text can be at any position. Our code detects the text location and Convolutional NN does the character recognition.
This project invoved keras for building Convolutional Neural Network and Image processing techniques like MSER.
The code can be run by executing ImageAnalaysis2.py along with charrecgweights1.h5 (contain weights obtained after training). The code take A.jpg as input image and gives text in the image.
